TODO LIST
---------

- Implement a "refresh" button to fetch news and issues (a menu button looks good, see if you can find a "release to refresh" sample).
- When user click on the issue a new activty starts, showing the title of the issue and the image. Also we should add two menu buttons, "view" and "share" that can do nothing for the moment.
- Block configuration changes on theme change.
- If possible, transform all the links in news in clickable elements.
